//GENERALISATION :

/*Converting a subclass type into a superclass type is called ‘Generalization‘ 
 * because we are making the subclass to become more general and its scope is widening.
 *  This is also called widening or up casting.
 *   Widening is safe because the classes will become more general.*/
